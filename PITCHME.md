# Pain Points ðŸ¥²

---

- You should be thinking of a couple of pain points in your life that you would like to solve with a simple CRUD app.
- It's best to think up more than one idea if you can, so that we have options to choose from.

---
# *Noticing* Pain Points ðŸ¥²

> The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not "think up" but "notice."

â€” Paul Graham, "[How to Get Startup Ideas](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)"

---

- The essay that quote is from is a good read, but don't (necessarily) try to think up billion dollar startup ideas
- Our goal here is to discover a good first learning project, not to change the world...just yet.
- Try to *notice* a real annoyance at work or at home or with friends that we can solve, even if for just one user â€” you.

# Urgent Problems
> Find someone with a really urgent problem. Imagine your arm is pinned underneath a boulder. You have 2 options. One option is gnaw off your own arm and your other option is to sign an LOI with this promising young startup. That's the kind of customer you want."

- Paul Buchheit, "[The Path to $100B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir3hGtg0Wog&t=2910s)"

# Vitamin, Pain Killer or Cure?

- Always think about your product or service in terms of the benefits it provides to its users.
- How well does it solve the pain for the customer?

---
# Vitamin
- Indirect, long-term benefits that address general health or minor problems
- Nice to have
- Wonâ€™t wreck your day if you forget to take them

---

# Pain Killer
- Necessary short-term fixes to pressing issues
- May not solve the underlying issue

---

# Cure
- Make the problem go away entirely.

---
# Vitamin, Pain Killer or Cure?

- Customersâ€™ willingness to pay (or use) depends directly on their need for your product.
- Pay significantly more for cures than vitamins.

---

> are people deeply passionate about what you're doing? Do customers love your product? I think it's more important to measure love than growth. If people absolutely love your product, they're going to tell other people, and your product is going to grow.
- Brian Chesky (Airbnb)

<!-- better to have 10 people LOVE your product than 100 who sort of like it -->
